    "<h2>Project specification</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to create a simple robot application that uses deep learning as well.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The application is to tell the robot what to do by simply writing numbers on a piece of paper\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and showing it to a camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed task is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Let the user write a handwritten single digit on a piece of paper\n",
    " - Make a shot of the drawing with a webcam\n",
    " - A deep learning model should reconize the digit (0-9)\n",
    " - A command is sent to the robot according to the the recognised digit\n",
    " - The robot performs the operation according to the recieved command\n",
    " \n",
    "By using digit recognition, we can distiguish 10 different images, so 10 different commands for the robot.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this project, these command will be to draw the recognized digit with the robot.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So, let's say the user drew a digit '5' to the paper and recorded it with the camera.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The digit is recognized as '5' and the robot draws a charater '5' as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task can be divided into subtasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Create a program that uses the webcam to capture images and prepares them to be fed to a deep learning model\n",
    " - Create a deep learning model and train it to recognize handwritten digits\n",
    " - Write a program that can give commands to the robot based on the output of the deep learning model\n",
    " - Create the robot program that performs the desired operation when it recieves the defined commands\n",
    " \n",
    "For now, we will solve the second subtask, that is to create a deep learning model and train it to recognize handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Subtask specification</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we have to have a dataset for training our network. We would like the model to recognize\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "handwritten digits, so the dataset should contain images of handwritten digits and associated ground-truth labels.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "That is why we will use the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This dataset gives us 60000 28x28 sized garyscale images for training and other 10000 images for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tesorflow this dataset can be loaded like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n",
    "(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where ```mnist.load_data()``` returns a tupe of the training and test data that are both tuples themselves, x meaning\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "the inputs (the images) and y meaning the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a dataset, we would like to build a deep neural network that can predict the correct label from the inputs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As there are finite number of labels (0-9) the task is classification.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The model should classify input images belonging to one of the classes labeled with 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the inputs have a fairly large size (28x28 = 784) for a fully connected neural network. Let's suppose we have\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "100 neurons in the first hidden layer of our model. This would result in 78500 parameters to tune just in the first layer\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "even if we use only 100 neurons. That's why we will be using convolutional layers that were specifically made for the purpose\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "of consuming massive data such as images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create convolutional layers we will use the following TensorFlow method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tf.nn.conv2d(\n",
    "    input,\n",
    "    filter,\n",
    "    strides,\n",
    "    padding,\n",
    "    use_cudnn_on_gpu=True,\n",
    "    data_format='NHWC',\n",
    "    dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "    name=None\n",
    ")```\n",
    "\n",
    "The best choice for the activation function of convolutional layers is the ReLU activation, but you are free to experiment\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "with different activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pooling layers betwwen convolutional layers to increase the scope the extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final layers of the network should be fully connected and as there are more than two classes the output should be a\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "probability distibution of classes. (So the labels must be converted to one-hot encoding).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So, the activation function of the output layer should be the softmax activation and the loss function will be the cross\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "entropy loss. In TensorFlow the loss function ```tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2()``` should be used.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This function applies the softmax function for its inputs, so the logits should be fed to it instead of the predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer can be chosen freely, but the Adam optimizer is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting of hyperparameters sucha as the number of layers, neuron number, batch size, learning rate etc. is all up to you.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, in order to be able to check which parameter setup works better we should divide the training set into two parts.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "One part is for training (50000) smaples and the other part (10000) samples is for validation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The network should not be trained on the validation set. It only should be used to evaluate the performance with \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "different parameter setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end the final model should be evaluated on the test set and it should be saved, so we can use it in our project.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this purpose we will be using the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tf.saved_model.simple_save(\n",
    "    session,\n",
    "    export_dir,\n",
    "    inputs,\n",
    "    outputs,\n",
    "    legacy_init_op=None\n",
    ")```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulted saved model can be converted to a format which can be used in a browser-based environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the following tasks should be done:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Load the MNIST dataset and split the original training set into training and validation sets\n",
    " - Prepare the data pipeline for tensorflow and scale the images if necessary\n",
    " - Build the convolutional neural network\n",
    " - Create the training process and evaluation of the model\n",
    " - Train models with different parameters and choose the best one according to the validation set\n",
    " - Evaluate the best performing model on the test set and save it for later use"
